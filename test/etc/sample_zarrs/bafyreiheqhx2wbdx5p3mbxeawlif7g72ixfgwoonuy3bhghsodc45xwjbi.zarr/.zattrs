    "dataset description": "PRISM climate datasets incorporate a variety of modeling techniques and are available at multiple spatial/temporal resolutions, covering the period from 1895 to the present. The grid cells analyzed are the standard PRISM 4km\nRather than calculating days based on the 24-hour period ending at midnight local time, PRISM defines a 'day' as the 24 hours ending at 12:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, or 7:00am Eastern Standard Time). This means that PRISM data for May 26, for example, actually refers to the 24 hours ending at 7:00am EST on May 26.\nMore dataset information at https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation\nMore information about reduced Gaussian Grids at  https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference",
